          Iâ€™m very grateful for you considering how you can partner with me to
          serve the students at UTAS. Although Launceston is a small and quiet
          campus, there is still a great need for people to hear the good news.

          Please prayerfully consider if you would be able to make a regular
          pledge of $25/$50/$100/month or another amount as you feel led. One
          off contributions are also very welcome.

          I hope to spend {supportData.time} days per week on campus but before
